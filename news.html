						<h1>What is News?</h1>
						<p>Generally news is a report on or information about a recent event; however, for WKCR, our news show is a little different from what you might hear on CNN or read in the New York Times. The news show at WKCR, Late City Edition, is committed to bringing content to our listeners that they might not have the opportunity to engage with otherwise. Whether this be interviews with professors, conversations around conflict resolution, dialogue about community concerns, or a speech from the archives, Late City Edition is devoted to providing relevant subject matter to Columbia University and the greater community.</p>

					<h1>Programming for News</h1>
					<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:15px">There are two aspects to being a news programmer: broadcasting content and creating content.</p>

					<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Broadcasting Content:</h5>

					<p>Late City Edition airs from 9-9:30 pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. The person who programs Late City Edition generally also programs the art show Arts and Answers which airs from 9:30-10 pm on the same days. Generally, the content played on Late City Edition comes in the form of pre-recorded cd, which simply has to be announced before playing.</p>
					<br>
					<h5 style="font-weight:bold">Creating Content:</h5>
					<p>News programmers are also expected to create content to be broadcasted. This could be either in the form of conducting an interview or multiple interviews or recording and event or panel that is happening. Most of the content for Late City Edition has very little post-production editing. All guests are required to fill out a WKCR Release Form. </p>
				</section>
				<hr width=75%>
				<section id="recommendations">
					<h1>Recommendations</h1>
					<p>When selecting for a news show, there are a few things that should be taken into account:</p>
						<ul style="color:black; font-size: 14px; list-style:circle; margin-left: 70px; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px">
							<li>How timely is the recording?</li>
							<li>How is the quality of this recording?</li>
							<li>How is this recording relevant to our audience?</li>
							<li>How long is this recording?</li>
						</ul>
					

					<p>Timeless is very important in choosing content, because if the content is not timely than chances are it also isn’t relevant. Late City Edition does not always air new or even recent content, but it is important that it makes sense to play the recording at this time. For instance, an interview about student-worker protests in 2005 might not necessarily make sense to play this time, but if you wanted to connect them to student-worker protests currently happening now, then that would be a justifiable reason for airing the older interview.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>The quality of the recording is pretty self-explanatory. Listen to the cd you want to play ahead of time to ensure that it doesn’t skip or cut out or isn’t too hard to hear.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The relevance of the recording is related to timeliness and something you should definitely think about. In your mic break, you might even want to explain to the audience why you think this recording is relevant. For example, perhaps you think this conversation from a few years about sustaining peace in Israel is still very relevant in the tumultuous state of the nation today.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The length of the recording by no means should be something that stops you from playing good content, but it’s something you should be aware of. If your interview is short, you might want to have another interview to play or music to fill the time until the next show. If you’re interview is long you might want to ask if it’s okay to spill over into arts, or to have the rest of the interview played the next day.</p>
