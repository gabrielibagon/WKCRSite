The New Music Department of WKCR seeks to explore the world of sound through experimental and avant-garde music. Although the term "New Music" is often used to decribe a movement of contemporary classical composition, WKCR uses the term to describe any music that attempts to stretch the boundaries of music and sound art. 




Initially, many newcomers to the department feel a bit confused about understanding the concept of New Music, especially being able to differentiate New Music from the music covered in the other departments at WKCR. The term is ambiguous, and there is no objective definition regarding the form or sound of New Music. Rather, consider New Music not about any specific genre or style, but more about the attitude and approach towards the art. New Music can come in any form, as long as it sufficiently challenges the listener in ways that attempt to break or redefine conventions of music or sound art. So, you can find examples of New Music on the fringes of any genre - classical, jazz, electronic music, rock, and so on. 

If you program for departments other than New Music, you may want to consider how to distinguish which department is most appropriate for certain experimental music. Movements like free jazz and indeterminate classical composition both stem from established musical traditions, but some pieces may appear so far removed from the sound of their respective heritage that it might not feel like it fits in with a show of another department. There is no simple answer to this question - it's a matter of taste and intuition. Each programmer and department head may have a different opinion on this matter, so feel free to develop your own approach to programming (or ask your department head). 

The best way to figure these things out and to establish your own taste in New Music is to develop a deep base of knowledge of the subject. You are in luck: this page consists of a number of resources to help you explore the world of New Music. Listen to the recommended artists, watch the videos, explore the online resources in order to develop a feel for New Music. Use these resources as a starting point towards finding your own methods of exploring New Music. Keep listening! Keep learning! You can do it!
